# ProjectAethra

A project inspired by an already existing futuresque device. I do not intend to benefit off this piece of code. It was only a sudden hiccup in the tantrum of my mundane lockdown life. It started when I saw this device being advertised on Youtube. A pair of glasses that people with impaired vision could wear- almost identical to the google glasses we had heard about a decade ago. But these were different, they would enable people to read menus, signboards and whatnot. All they had to do was point their finger in the direction of an object, and the camera attached to the glasses would read out loud whatever was written above their fingertip.

The hardware is of-course not within my abilities to create, but I know I could work on the code to replicate atleast a sliver of this miracle.
